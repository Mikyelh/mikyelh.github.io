<h1> Quick hummus recipe </h1>

<p> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that
    I have read over the years.</p>

<p><strong> <u>Hummus</u> is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.</strong> It is very tasty
    with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<code>
<p>
    <em> I can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br>
        175g of tahini <br>
        6 sundried tomatoes <br>
        Half a red pepper<br>
        A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
        1 clove of garlic<br>
        A dash of olive oil<br>
    </em>
</p>
</code>

    <mark> <del>Remove</del> the skin from <ins>the garlic,</ins> and chop coarsely</mark> <br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely <br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor <br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste. <br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>
</p>

<p> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you. </p>

<h3> <blockquote>Storage</blockquote>  </h3>

<p> Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>
<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
